general rest service to minimize calls

look for model in current array by id, if it exists return
if it doesn't exist fetch
if fetch fails create an empty object

otherwise loop through properties
if property is an array of objects,
looks for another service with the same name, ( eg sets: [{},{}]) setsService
pass the objects to that service's collection
